# Book-recommender

Welcome to our Book Recommendation System project, developed by Eduard-Adiel Dinu, Elena-Bianca Dumitru, Aksel Hodne Hanisch, and Lars Huitfeldt Flem. The goal of this project is to create a robust and scalable system that provides personalized book recommendations to users based on their preferences, reading history, and trends. Our system leverages a combination of collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and natural language processing (NLP) to offer diverse and relevant book suggestions.

We are committed to enhancing user experience through an adaptive recommendation engine that caters to a wide range of user tastes while addressing common challenges like cold starts and data sparsity. This README provides an overview of our project structure, setup, and development process.
