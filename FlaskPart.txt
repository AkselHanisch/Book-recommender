app.py
content_based_file.py
user_based_file.py
nlp_based_file.py
make_matrix.py
NLP_TFIDF.py

In the app.py are the main functions to search books to rate them, receive recommendations, etc
In make_matrix.py makes the npy matrixes


How to run: python app.py
Then go to the browser to the link http://127.0.0.1:5000
Hit next -> the user-form -> complete with the name, location, age -> in the background a new user id will be generated and added in the Users.csv -> book selection, where a user chooses the books he/she read click on submit -> rate books where the previous selected books are rated by the user and submitted -> the recommendation part HERE is the problem: the functions need to be changed
